# sizeof
sizeof is a command line program for determining the size of files and directories in bytes and number of files. It is written in C++.

# Usage
Simply pass in a file or directory as the first command line argument: ```sizeof my_file```. The ```-v``` option can be 
passed as the last argument for verbose output, and the ```-vv``` flag for super verbose output. 

## Output
sizeof will output the size in a human readable unit (bytes, KiB, MiB, GiB) and the number of files if the input is a directory.
Any file that is skipped because the size it not determinable will be printed only if verbose output is enabled. The individial sizes, counts
and running total will be printed with super verbose output. 
Sample run:
```
sizeof ~
SKIPPED: size is not determinable: "/home/lucas/.steam/steam.pipe"
/home/lucas is 18.00 gigabytes with 136223 files.
```

## Compilation
Run ```make``` to compile to program. ```make install``` can be used to install the program to /usr/local/bin 
so that it may be run system wide. The install path may be changed by editing the ```INSTALL_PATH``` variable,
for example: ```make install INSTALL_PATH=~/programs```. This program only relies on the C++17 standard libraries,
and as such your version of GCC must support these features to compile the program.

## Bugs

- Fixed issues with root filesystems like /proc/.
